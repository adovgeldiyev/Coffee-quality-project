#A Good Ole Cup of Joe: What Contributes to a Quality Cup
To determine what makes a good cup of coffee, there are a number of layers that one
could analyze. There are an unimaginable number of influences from how the coffee beans are
roasted all the way down to the chemical makeup of the coffee beans. With that context in
mind, our group started analyzing a dataset of objective measures for coffee quality. The
dataset contained details relating to the origin of the coffee beans in addition to specific
measures of taste and quality that affected the overall score of the cup of coffee that is
referred to as “cupper points.” Using this measure of cupper points to understand the overall
quality of the coffee, our group sought to understand the factors that determined why some
cups of coffee were better than others. More specifically, our group sought to understand what
factors were most important in determining coffee quality, as well as beginning some
exploratory analysis for how those factors affected one another.
